                <p>
                    Recurrent brain tumors are often hard to treat because they grow aggressively and asymptomatically, and are detected too late.

            <p><strong>Core Need</strong></p>
            <p>
                Patient ambulation is crucial to proper recovery for patients with extended stays in the intensive care unit. 
                However, difficulties with managing the patient's care during ambulation make ambulation difficult. 
                Current methods for ambulation are inefficient, unsafe, and therefore infrequently done.        
            </p>

            <p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
            <p>
                By working with doctors and nurses in the Johns Hopkins Hospital's Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, as well as engineers from the Whiting School of Engineering 
                at Johns Hopkins, we developed the <em>AmbuMate:</em> a device that makes patient ambulation safe and easy. 

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Transports all necessary patient equipment</li>
                <li>Novel wire and tube management system</li>
                <li>Multiple support methods for patient fatigue</li>
                <li>Attaches to the patient's native IV pole</li>
                <li>Integrates seamlessly into clinical workflows</li>
                <li>Requires only one nurse for effective use</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In an IRB study conducted at Johns Hopkins Hospital, 95% of nurses felt
                AmbuMate would significantly improve ambulation.
