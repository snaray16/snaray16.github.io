<h2 id="project1">Flexible Ultrasound Array Shape Estimation</h2>
<p>While at Stanford, I worked on an approach for flexible array shape estimation on a conformal ultrasound array 
    sensor intended for wearable imaging applications. 

    Wearable imaging has a lot of potential benefits - longitudinal and remote monitoring, for example, 
    to predict or monitor the progress of health conditions ranging from blood pressure and heart disease to 
    musculoskeletal strain. 

    The challenge with a conformal/wearable array is that, in contrast to a rigid ultrasound sensor, 
    as a patient moves, there is resulting uncertainty in the locations of element positions within the 
    ultrasound array, posing a major challenge for image reconstruction. Because the exact positions of elements 
    are unknown, the time-of-flight to and from regions in the field of view are unknown, preventing proper 
    focusing. Rotations of elements also means that transmitted pressure and receive sensitivity fields are 
    affected. These errors lead to aberrated wavefronts after focusing, resulting in distorted point spread 
    functions and poor spatial resolution in our ultrasound image. This is a major challenge that must be 
    overcome in order for wearable or conformal ultrasound devices to be feasible. Specifically, we need to know 
    where the elements are in the array so that we can apply the right phase-delays for image reconstruction. 

    The video shows a differential delay and sum beamforming approach where positions of elements are iteratively 
    updated to minimize a loss function. The ‘clever/elegant’ approach I’ll highlight is in the loss function 
    chosen: By the van Cittert-Zernike theorem for pulse-echo ultrasound, it is known that backscattered signals 
    from diffuse scatterers should have high coherence between transmit-receiver pairs in the array that share a 
    common midpoint. Any residual phase shift between two such pairs arises due to inaccuracies in the assumed 
    beamforming model. Essentially, this theorem gives us a loss function that allows us to maximize coherence on 
    scatterers, and iteratively approach the true conformal geometry of the array, as you can see in the video. 
    We used point scatterers to make this visualization clear and not too computationally expensive. I find it 
    pretty satisfying to watch this iterative process progress towards the correct array shape.
