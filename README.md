About Me: 
I am an engineer with specialized experience in time-of-flight sensing systems - including passive acoustic recorders, ultrasound, radar, and LiDAR - combined with experience building applied ML systems that handle the data acquired from these systems. I am impact-driven and am particularly interested in work that connects humans to the natural world, addresses environmental challenges, advances conservation efforts, and assists in combating climate change.

I received my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University with a focus on time-of-flight sensing systems, applied ML, and circuits. I received my B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, focusing on Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation, with Minors in both Entrepreneurship & Management and Music.
